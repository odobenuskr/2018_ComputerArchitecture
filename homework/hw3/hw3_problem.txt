•Write a MIPS assembly source code which does the same thing as in the following C program segments.
(Make the array ‘a’ starts at address 0x10004000)

int a[] = { -1, 0x1234, 0x00ff };

int main(){

   a[0] = a[1];

   a[1] = a[2];

   a[2] = 10;

}

•Load your source into SPIM and confirm it works as intended.
• Submit your assembly source code in ecampus. (Do not submit a file.)
