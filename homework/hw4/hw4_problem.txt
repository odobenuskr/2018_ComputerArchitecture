•Write a MIPS assembly source code which does the same thing as in the following C program segments.
         (Make the array ‘a’ starts at address 0x10004000,

          use $t1 for variable i,

          do not use a pseudoinstruction )



int a[] = { -1, 0x1234, 0x00ff };

int main(){

   for (int i=0; i<2; i++){

     a[i] = a[i+1];

   }

}

•Load your source into SPIM and confirm it works as intended.
• Submit your assembly source code in ecampus. (Do not submit a file.)
